    <strong>Firm Behavior at an Environmental Regulatory Threshold: Empirical Evidence from the Norwegian Salmon Aquaculture Traffic Light Regulation</strong><br>
    <a href="jmp.pdf">Download PDF</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    This paper provides causal evidence on how firms adjust their behavior in response to an ambient, threshold-based environmental regulation. I study Norway’s “Traffic Light System” for salmon aquaculture, which classifies coastal production areas into green, yellow, or red zones based on observed sea-lice levels and ties future production opportunities to these color assignments. I assemble a site-level panel for 2017–2021 covering almost all Norwegian salmon farms, with monthly biomass, weekly treatment intensity, and weekly lice levels.
  </p>

  <p>
    The analysis focuses on active, high-biomass sites located within 30 km of internal Traffic Light borders, where neighboring farms operate in the same coastal environment but face different regulatory stringency. I exploit these spatial discontinuities in a sharp geographic regression discontinuity design comparing sites just inside red zones to sites just inside non-red zones. The main outcome is treatment intensity at the site level, interpreted as firms’ operational response to tighter regulation. I find that farms assigned to red areas substantially increase the use of lice treatments relative to nearby farms in yellow/green areas, consistent with stronger compliance efforts under more stringent classifications. The design is complemented by placebo contrasts along borders with identical colors and by restrictions to high-activity periods.
  </p>

  <p>
    The paper speaks to the empirical literature on firm responses to environmental regulation, showing that an ambient, threshold-based policy can induce significant changes in costly abatement behavior without taking a stand on welfare or environmental effectiveness.
